# Azure SIEM Cyberattack Monitoring and Threat Intelligence Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a cloud-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using **Microsoft Azure Sentinel**. It simulates real-world cyberattacks and provides real-time threat detection, analysis, and response using **PowerShell**, **KQL (Kusto Query Language)**, and custom alert rules. The environment incorporates **honeypots**, **geo-visualization**, and **automated alerting** for enhanced threat intelligence and security operations experience.

## Key Features

- üîç **SIEM Integration:** Configured Azure Sentinel with custom data connectors to collect and analyze log data from multiple sources.
- üêç **Honeypot Deployment:** Simulated brute-force attacks using Python-based attack scripts targeting RDP-enabled Windows VMs.
- üß† **Threat Detection:** Developed KQL queries to detect malicious IPs, abnormal login attempts, and behavioral anomalies.
- üåç **Geo-Location Visualization:** Enabled map-based visualization of attacker locations via workbook integration.
- üö® **Alerting & Automation:** Created analytics rules to trigger alerts and incidents automatically upon detection of threats.
- üíª **PowerShell Scripting:** Used PowerShell to generate test attack scenarios, log events, and manage VM operations.
- üìà **Dashboard Creation:** Built a custom Sentinel dashboard to monitor attack metrics and incident trends in real time.
