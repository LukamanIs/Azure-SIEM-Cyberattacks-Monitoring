🛠️ Instructions – Full Setup & Simulation Guide
This guide outlines the full setup process for deploying a honeypot VM in Azure, integrating it with Azure Sentinel (SIEM), simulating cyberattacks, and analyzing real-time alerts using KQL queries and dashboards.

☁️ 1. Set Up Log Analytics Workspace
Go to Azure Portal → search for Log Analytics Workspaces.

Click + Create → provide:

Workspace name (e.g., SentinelWorkspace01)

Resource Group (create new or use existing)

Region: Choose the same as your future VM

Once created, go to Advanced Settings:

Note the Workspace ID and Primary Key. You’ll need these to connect agents later.

🧠 2. Deploy Azure Sentinel
Navigate to Azure Sentinel via the search bar or All Services.

Click + Add → select the Log Analytics Workspace you just created.

Azure Sentinel is now enabled on that workspace, ready to collect and analyze logs.

🧱 3. Deploy a Honeypot Virtual Machine (Windows)
Go to Virtual Machines → Create > Virtual Machine.

Use these settings:

Image: Windows Server 2019 or 2022

Size: B2s or similar (small instance)

Inbound ports: Open RDP (port 3389) – this will allow brute-force attacks.

Public IP: Assign a static IP for consistent testing.

After deployment, note the public IP address and admin credentials.

🕵️ 4. Install Log Analytics Agent on VM
Download the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) inside your Windows VM.

Use the Workspace ID and Primary Key from Step 1.

Select Azure Commercial cloud.

This links your VM to your Log Analytics Workspace for log collection.

💥 5. Simulate a Brute-Force Attack
From another machine (e.g., Kali Linux or another cloud VM):

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
cd YOUR-REPO
Run the RDP brute-force attack script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 rdp_brute_force.py --target [VM_PUBLIC_IP] --user Admin --wordlist wordlist.txt
The script will attempt multiple failed logins to trigger alerts in Sentinel.

🔌 6. Connect Data Sources in Sentinel
Go to Azure Sentinel > Configuration > Data Connectors:

Enable and configure:

Security Events (from the VM)

Sign-in logs

Azure Activity Logs

Validate that logs are flowing to Log Analytics Workspace > Logs.

🔍 7. Analyze Logs with KQL Queries
Go to Azure Sentinel > Logs.

Start with a simple failed login detection:

kql
Copy
Edit
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize FailedLogins = count() by Account, IPAddress, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where FailedLogins > 5
Explore and refine queries using:

SecurityEvent, SigninLogs, Heartbeat, etc.

Save useful queries under Query Packs.

📊 8. Create Dashboards & Workbooks
Go to Workbooks → Create a new workbook.

Add:

Line charts for failed logins over time.

Maps to track attacker geolocation via IP.

KPI tiles to display brute-force attempts and successful logins.

Save and pin dashboards to your Sentinel overview.

🚨 9. Build Alerts & Automation
Under Analytics Rules, create:

Scheduled Rules to monitor for brute-force patterns.

Custom Rule Templates using your KQL queries.

Optional: Use Logic Apps to build automated playbooks for:

Email/SMS alerts

Blocking IPs

Opening tickets in tools like ServiceNow

✅ Outcome
After setup and simulation, you will:

Successfully monitor cyberattack behaviors in a cloud environment.

Visualize threats using dashboards and map-based analytics.

Detect brute-force RDP attempts and other anomalies in real-time.

Prove hands-on experience with SIEM, KQL, PowerShell, and cloud security engineering.
